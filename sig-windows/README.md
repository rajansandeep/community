## Getting Started

If you're looking for information on building and running containers on Windows, you can get started at http://aka.ms/windowscontainers .

Kubernetes 1.9 includes beta support for Windows Server containers and has an up-to-date [Getting Started Guide for Windows](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/windows/) .

Some additional guides are available, but may refer to older releases:

* Using host gateway networking: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/kubernetes/getting-started-kubernetes-windows 
* Using OVN as demonstrated at Google Cloud Next '17: https://github.com/apprenda/kubernetes-ovn-heterogeneous-cluster

## Contributing

We're currently using a public [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/rjTqrwjl/windows-k8s-roadmap) in the weekly SIG-Windows meeting to track items with active progress for each release. That's a great place to start to get the most up-to-date status, then feel free to join us on the Slack channel anytime with questions.

As always, you can also find the active list of open issues and proposals [Open Code Issues and PRs for SIG/Windows](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/labels/sig%2Fwindows) on GitHub.

## API tracking
We also have an [API tracking](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-windows/api-tracking.md) document that we're building out to track areas where the APIs may not be implemented or need to change for Windows.

## Meeting Recordings

Past meetings are in the [Recorded Meetings Playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL69nYSiGNLP2OH9InCcNkWNu2bl-gmIU4&jct=LZ9EIvD4DGrhr2h4r0ItaBmco7gTgw)
