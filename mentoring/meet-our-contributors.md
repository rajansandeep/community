# Meet Our Contributors - Ask Us Anything! 

When Slack seems like it’s going too fast, and you just need a quick answer from a human...

Meet Our Contributors gives you a monthly one-hour opportunity to ask questions about our upstream community, watch interviews with our contributors, and participate in peer code reviews.

## When:
Every first Wednesday of the month at the following times. Grab a copy of the calendar to yours from [kubernetes.io/community](https://kubernetes.io/community/)
* 03:30pm UTC 
* 09:00pm UTC 

Tune into the [Kubernetes YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/KubernetesCommunity/live) to follow along with video and [#meet-our-contributors](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/meet-our-contributors) on Slack for questions and discourse. 

## What’s on-topic: 
* How our contributors got started with k8s
* Advice for getting attention on your PR
* GitHub tooling and automation
* Your first commit
* kubernetes/community
* Testing 

## What’s off-topic:
* End-user questions (Check out [#office-hours](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/office-hours) on slack and details [here](/events/office-hours.md))

## Submitting questions and/or code for review/walk through:
### Questions:
* Day of on twitter - use the hashtag [#k8smoc](https://twitter.com/hashtag/k8smoc) after your question   
* Slack - Ask your question in [#meet-our-contributors](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/meet-our-contributors)


Questions will be on a first-come, first-served basis. First half will be dedicated to questions for contributors and the second half, we will pick a problem (in advance) for peer code review.

### Code snip / PR for peer code review / Suggestion for part of codebase walk through:
* At least 24 hours before the session to slack channel (#meet-our-contributors)

Problems will be picked based on time commitment needed, skills of the reviewer, and if a large amount are submitted, need for the project. 

## Call for Volunteers:
Contributors - [sign up to answer questions!](https://goo.gl/uhEJ33) 

Expectations of volunteers:
* Be on 5 mins early. You can look at questions in the queue by joining the #meet-our-contributors slack channel to give yourself some prep.
* Expect questions about the contribution process, membership, navigating the kubernetes seas, testing, and general questions about you and your path to open source/kubernetes. It's ok if you don't know the answer!
* We will be using video chat (zoom but live streaming through YouTube) but voice only is fine if you are more comfortable with that.
* Be willing to provide suggestions and feedback to make this better!
